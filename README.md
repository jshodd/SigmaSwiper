With many events ran by student organizations in colleges, they want to keep track of who is attending their events. This program provides a way to log all guest entries by using the student ID cards and swiping guests in. The program uses pandas to create an Excel file storing all the number of guests, the student ID of each guest, and the time of arrival. A guest list can also be loaded into the program to restrict access to an event, thus saving these organizations even more time. Features will be added to this program as suggestions are made, but my current goals for the future include: buidling a database of student names in association to their ID numbers to provide more information in the exported excel sheet, creating an easy installer for less technical users to install this on their organization's computer, using pandas and matplotlib to create a chart or graph visualizing what times saw the most amounts of guests.
